        <h3>Electronic Commerce</h3>
        <p class="gruppo4">E-commerce (Electronic Commerce) refers to the buying and selling of goods, services, or
            information over the
            internet and other electronic networks.
            It involves the exchange of products or services between businesses, consumers, or both, using digital
            platforms and technologies.
            In simpler terms, it's any commercial transaction that happens online. Instead of going to a physical store,
            you use a computer, tablet,
            or smartphone to browse products, place orders, and make payments. Common types of e-commerce are: B2B
            e-commerce, B2C e-commerce and
            C2C e-commerce. </p>

        <h3>Online shopping</h3>
        <p class="gruppo4">Online shopping represents the most prevalent form of e-commerce, directly connecting
            companies with their
            end consumers. This popular method allows
            individuals to purchase products through a company's dedicated online shop, which can often be accessed via
            websites or convenient mobile applications.
            These digital storefronts typically display a comprehensive range of products offered by the company,
            complete with detailed pricing information.
            Once a selection is made and an order is placed, the purchased items are then prepared and dispatched,
            usually arriving at the customer's doorstep in
            a package delivered by a courier or the postal service.

        <h3>The pros and the cons for the consumer...</h3>
        <p class="gruppo4">Online shopping offers distinct advantages for customers, notably lower prices and the
            convenience of 24/7
            availability,
            allowing purchases from virtually anywhere. However, a significant drawback is the inability to physically
            examine,
            touch, or try on products before making a purchase.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>...and for companies</h3>
        <p class="gruppo4">The pros for the companies are: <br> - Setting up an online shop is usually very cheap or
            even free
            <br> - The online shop mostly works automatically <br> - With an online shop, you can sell to people located
            anywhere
        </p>
        <p class="gruppo4">The cons for the companies are: <br> - The products in online shops have to be stored
            somewhere <br>
            - Online shops have to compete with shops all around the world <br> - In online shops customers can't talk
            to someone before buying a product </p>

        <h3>Setting up an online shop</h3>
        <p class="gruppo4">Setting up an online shop is streamlined by using an e-commerce platform. These platforms
            enable businesses
            to quickly launch
            a website where customers can easily find and purchase products. The primary task for the company then
            becomes shipping the
            product directly from their warehouse to the customer. Popular examples of such platforms include Shopify,
            which is known for
            being very affordable, and Amazon, where the associated fees are considerably higher.</p>

        <h3>B2B e-commerce</h3>
        <p class="gruppo4">B2B e-commerce (Business-to-Business e-commerce) refers to the online exchange of products,
            services, or
            information between two businesses.
            In simpler terms, it's when one company sells something to another company using the internet. This is
            different from B2C (Business-to-Consumer) e-commerce, where a business sells directly to an individual
            customer.
            Key aspects of B2B e-commerce include: digital platform, business buyers, complex transactions, long-term
            relationships and automation.</p>

        <h3>Warehousing and storage</h3>
        <p class="gruppo4">While often used interchangeably, "warehousing" and "storage" have distinct meanings,
            especially in the
            context of business and supply chain management.
            In its simplest form, storage is the act of keeping something in a safe place until it is needed.
            The primary focus of storage is simply to hold goods securely and protect them from damage, theft, or
            deterioration.
            Warehousing is a more comprehensive and organized process than simple storage. It involves the strategic
            management of goods within a dedicated facility (a warehouse) from the moment they arrive until they are
            ready to be shipped out.
            Warehousing is a critical part of the supply chain and goes beyond just holding items.
            All warehousing involves storage, but not all storage is warehousing. For example, a self-storage unit is
            for storage,
            but a large logistics center managing inventory for multiple clients is engaged in warehousing.
