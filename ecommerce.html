    <h3>E-commerce is short for electronic commerce The term describes all types of commerce that happen online (buying,
        selling, promoting through Internet).</h3>
    <h2>Online shopping</h2>
    <h3>It is the most common type of e-commerce. This is when a company sells products to an end consumer through an
        online shop. Some online shops also have apps that allow you to buy products with a few taps on your phone.
        In online shops you can generally see all the products that a certain company sells and their prices. Usually,
        the product will then be sent to you in a package through a courier or the postal service.

    <h2>The pros and the cons for the consumer...</h2>
    <h3>The pros for the customers are that products online are often cheaper, shops are open 24/7 and they can buy
        products wherever they are. A disadvantage is that customers can’t see, touch, or try the product before they
        buy it. </h3>
    <h2>...and for companies</h2>
    <h3>The pros for the companies are:
        <ul>
            <li>Setting up an online shop is usually very cheap or even free</li>
            <li>The online shop mostly works automatically</li>
            <li>With an online shop, you can sell to people located anywhere</li>
        </ul>
        The cons for the companies are:
        <ul>
            <li>The products in online shops have to be stored somewhere</li>
            <li>Online shops have to compete with shops all around the world</li>
            <li>In online shops customers can't talk to someone before buying a product</li>
        </ul>
    </h3>
    <h2>Setting up an online shop</h2>
    <h3>The easiest way to set up an online shopping is to use an e-commerce platform to create a website where the
        customers can search and buy a product quickly. The only part that the company has to do is to ship the product
        from their warehouse to the end customer. Examples of e-commerce platforms include Shopify, which is very cheap
        to use, and Amazon, where the fees are much higher.</h3>
    <h2>B2B e-commerce</h2>
    <h3>Business-to-business e-commerce means that instead of selling to consumers, a company sells its products to
        another company using a website.</h3>
    <h2>Warehousing and storage</h2>
    <h3>The terms "warehousing" and "storage" are often used interchangeably, but there are some differences between
        them. Storage refers to the act of keeping goods in a designated place. Focuses on storage management and the
        organization of goods. Warehousing refers to the process of managing a stockroom.
